## Project Insights

- Total Employees: 1,470 with Attrition Rate: 16.1% (237 employees).

- Highest Attrition by Job Role: Laboratory Technicians (62), Sales Executives (57), and Research Scientists (47).

- Attrition by Salary Slab: Majority of attrition occurs in the ≤5k range.

- Education Impact: Employees from Life Sciences (38%) and Medical fields (27%) dominate attrition numbers.

- Age Trends: Employees aged 26–35 have the highest attrition count.

- Tenure Effect: Most attrition happens within the first 5 years of employment.

- Gender Difference: Males (140) show higher attrition than females (79).


 ## Final Conclusion
Attrition is concentrated among younger employees, low salary brackets, and specific job roles such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives. Addressing compensation, career growth, and onboarding engagement in early years could significantly reduce turnover.
